# Design patterns in golang

## Strategy
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Singleton
Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

## Composite
Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
